1. Tour the Taj Mahal in Agra

The Taj Mahal is not just one of the top attractions in Indiaâ€“it's one of the most famous monuments in the world. The pristine white mausoleum was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, after she died in childbirth in 1631.

Construction of the mausoleum, along with its adjunct buildings and surrounding complex, required the labor of more than 20,000 workers over the span of 22 years.

Knowing the backstory of the Taj Mahal can give you a deeper appreciation for the famous Agra attraction when you visit in person. Try to arrive around sunrise, when the building takes on a lavender-gold hue, and you can photograph it in all its glory without the crowds. It's definitely worth the early wake-up call.

2. Step inside Royal Forts and Palaces in Jaipur

After visiting the Taj Mahal, you can continue reveling in the grandeur of India in Jaipur, located roughly four hours away from Agra by train.

The "Pink City" is best known for its City Palace, an enchanting complex that has stood for close to 300 years and continues to be the residence for Jaipur's royal family today. The sand- and rose-hued palace blends Rajput, European, and Mughal architectural styles.

While at the complex, you can also wander around the Mubarak Mahal (Welcome Palace), visit the Armory (which houses a vast collection of inlaid weapons), and see some of the world's largest silver objects at the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience).

The City Palace might be the crown jewel of Jaipur, but it's far from the only regal attraction around the city. Other top places to visit in Jaipur include the honeycombed Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze) and the stately Amer Fort.

3. Make a Pilgrimage to Varanasi

India is a deeply spiritual place, and there's no better place to experience this quality than in Varanasi. Here, you can see pilgrims wash away their sins in the Ganges River, then return after dark for the fire-fueled prayer ceremony of Ganga Aarti at the Dasaswamedh Ghat (listen for the distinctive blow of a conch shell, which signals the start of the ritual). It's one of the highlights of a visit to Varanasi.

Toward the end of their lives, many Hindus make their way back to Varanasi, believing they can break free of the cycle of rebirth by being cremated along the banks of the holy Ganges. As a result, open-air cremations take place at Manikarnika Ghat perpetually throughout the day and night.

You can see these cremations up close, but it's often emotionally easier for tourists to witness the smoke plumes from afar on a boat tour. Either way, it's likely to be one of the most profound experiences you'll have in India.
